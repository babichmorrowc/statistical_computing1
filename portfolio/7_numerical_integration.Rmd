## Integration

## Quadrature

Polynomial interpolation is at the heart of quadrature. To use quadrature, we'll start by numerically approximating the definite integral of a function over a finite interval using a polynomial function, since polynomials can be integrated exactly.

### Lagrange polynomials

Get a unique polynomial through the $k$ points, with maximum degree of $k-1$

### Polynomial interpolation error

### Composite polynomial interpretation

Instead, we can create a piecewise polynomial approximation

## Monte Carlo

For one-dimensional integrals, quadrature is an appropriate technique. For higher dimensions, however, quadrature rules become far too computationally expensive. Monte Carlo algorithms are a good alternative in these higher dimensions.
