### Expanding package functionality

I had an Australian scientist named Fonti Kar reach out to me about how we might modify my R package to be used to convert alpha hulls for IUCN range assessments. The developer of the `alphahull` package, Beatriz Pateiro, has been working on a new feature to create alpha-hull objects following the IUCN Red List method of creation.

She can add documentation / tests / GitHub actions / landing page 
We could do a Hex sticker
I will work on the maths
What's the other package that does this?
